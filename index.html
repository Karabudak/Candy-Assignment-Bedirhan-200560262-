        <p>Smarties® are made 24 hours a day in two candy factories located in Union, New Jersey and Newmarket, Ontario. The company produces BILLIONS of Smarties® rolls each year.</p>
        <p>Did you know the Smarties Candy Company is run by three women? After founder Edward Dee left the business, his two sons Michael and Jonathan took over the family business, and then Dee's three granddaughters, all in their 30s as of 2019, took over as co-presidents. Sarah Dee, Liz Dee, and Jessica Sawyer grew up in the Smarties factory, they absolutely intend to keep the family tradition going, hoping their children will someday take over and and truly keeping it a family tradition. </p>
        <p>Each of the six flavors are made individually with their separate coloring and flavoring, and once compressed they're put into buckets. Each of the buckets are eventually combined to mix the colors, before they head to different machines for packaging. </p>
